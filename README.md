Update(2-11-2018): I believe it's done. There is one thing that I'm not too sure of how to go about fixing. For some reason when I call a function for the "No Thanks" button, it does a weird thing where it refreshes the screen/flickers as opposed to running the function. I even replaced the function being called on for the "X" button window closing function (which works), and it seems to do the same thing.
